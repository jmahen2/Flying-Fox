## R Markdown

### Description and Project responsibilities

Austin and I will be writing code for data from BioSeb Dynamic Weight Bearing Pain Analysis. The data is for pain differences in different destabilization surgeries in mice. We will organize the data into groups and analyze the data using a t test and put the data into graphs.  




This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
